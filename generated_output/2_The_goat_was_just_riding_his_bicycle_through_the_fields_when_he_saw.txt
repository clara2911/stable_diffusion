The goat was just riding his bicycle through the fields when he saw ichthyologists coming and taking pictures of what looked like goats.
"They were very nice to us when we walked by it and we saw what an amazing thing the goat looked like, and the sheep were very sad at seeing that," said Dr.
 Ritchie.
At the end of the afternoon, a big dog called the pig came and led the herd home, carrying a large pile of hay.
 He and another companion were given the goat's name.
