The goat was just riding his bicycle through the fields when he saw  one of his own riding in his backyard with his two children.
 The goat was startled to find that his brother was standing just outside and was on the other side of the fence.
 The goat didn't know who it was and wasn't sure what to do.
  Then he saw the goat in the doorway to his home.
 It was too bright and loud to be seen from outside, so he ran outside.
 So his brother followed him to the back of his yard where they had a picnic on a nearby tree where he heard one of the cows talking.
 It was strange that the goat looked just like the goat from the outside but the goat was so much different from him.
