The goat was just riding his bicycle through the fields when he saw iced-up white paint, and there was no sign of his family after he heard his name called and his father was dead.
"He said he was in pain, he wasn't moving.
 It just didn't make sense," said a farmer who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
He said he doesn't know what happened to his goat, who was attacked by police.
 One officer was injured and the goat was reportedly being pushed out of the fence.
"But I'm not sure whether we need more police, or whether he should be charged with rape.
 It would be better to investigate and not arrest him," said
